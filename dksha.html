  DKSHA – Deva Kirubai Social Help Association was founded in 1993 in Mullippadi Village (Tiruchirappalli) in the civil district of Tamil Nadu State in India.

We are a rural, community-based, grassroots-level non-governmental, self-funded set up which serves disadvantaged individuals including orphans, vulnerable children, rural, marginalised and financially insufficient men and women living in village communities, irrespective of their religion, race, ethnicity or gender.

We have a partner funding agency, Miracle Foundation, with whom we collaborate to improve the lives and well-being of hundreds of children and families and we have been the grateful recipients of funding from numerous other organisations.

We are a registered charity and we are always thankful for donations and offers of help.

We hope you enjoy looking round our website and learning about our work.
